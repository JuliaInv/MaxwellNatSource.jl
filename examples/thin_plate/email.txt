 
Here is a sample model response of a 4000m x 4000m vertical conductor in a 2000 ohm-m halfspace.
The conductance is 1S and it is buried at 1000m.  The 20 km line (x=-10000,10000)  is the
principal profile centred on the conductor.  The conductor is striking in the Y direction.  The
result is for the principal polarization (H in the x direction).  The names are encoded with the
frequency.  Unfortunately they came out sorted alphabetically which makes things awkward.  The
list of frequencies is in a separate file.  “SC” stands for scattered and “TOMF” is total minus
free space.
